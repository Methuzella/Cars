// Referencing


//A feature that allows you to create an alias(alternative name) for a variable  and any operation performed on the reference directly affects the original variable.

Where would you see referencing?

(1) Reference declaration

Example 
int a = 5;     
int &ref = a;  // ref is a reference to a, (note how a was initialized, now the reference cannot be changed to another name)//now if ref is change to 24  then a changes too.
a referencerence can be constant(cannot be modiefied) this is done by adding the "const" type modifier to the reference..."const int &ref = a;" but this is mostly done when passing large object  you don't want modified(done by const) and copied(done by &)

(2)Passing Arguments by Reference
//When you pass arguments to functions by reference, the function can modify the original variables (if they are non-const) not the copies typically made.
 example 
void modify(int &x) {
    x = 20;
}
int num = 10;
modify(num);  // num becomes 20
